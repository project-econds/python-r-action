## For Python

When you want to set up a github action pipline which uses python you should have a look [at the Github Action documentation for build & test](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/use-cases-and-examples/building-and-testing/building-and-testing-python). This is a good starter how to structure your github action `.yml` file. There are also examples how to implement code linting in github actions.

## For R

A very good resource with reusable github actions for R is in the [repository actions](https://github.com/r-lib/actions). There are standard github action workflows also implemented as examples.
Furthermore there is a [nice little book dealing with github actions in R](https://orchid00.github.io/actions_sandbox/) from Chris Brown, Murray Cadzow, Paula A Martinez, Rhydwyn McGuire, David Neuzerling, David Wilkinson and Saras Windecker from 2021.
